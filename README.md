# Automated-ArcReader-Update
Here's the start of a python program to automate the copy &amp; export of an SDE geodatabase for use in disconnected (no internet access) remote laptop environment. Replication of the SDE geodatabase was not an option since the entire database was too large; therefore we needed to select a subset of all feature datasets and feature classes to copy into a PortableDuluth.gdb. This python program also automates copying, clipping, &amp; export of parcel layers for ownership. The script creates a track log of all procedures completed with logging any errors as well as gives a script runtime.
